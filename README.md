I'm taking my first dip into the world of GitHub by following a little tutorial. This is the kind of stuff I live for. I detest stagnancy and am always pushing myself to learn new things and grow. It's a bonus for me if what I'm learning is something other's wouldn't expect me to know. I love being the person who has the answers or will come to the rescue by finding them and presenting them. It's not uncommon for me to overhear a problem others are having, track down the solution and present it to those in need along with all the applicable resources. I'm an 'ear-hustler, baby', and I'm the kind you want to know.
